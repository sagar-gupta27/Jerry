# 🐭 Jerry Server — A Lightweight Custom HTTP Server in Java

Jerry  is a minimalist yet powerful HTTP server built from scratch in **Java**, inspired by the internals of **Apache Tomcat**, specifically its **Coyote** connector and **Catalina** servlet engine.

This project demonstrates how low-level TCP socket communication can be used to parse, route, and serve HTTP requests — offering a foundational understanding of how modern Java web servers work under the hood.
